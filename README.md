# hello-world
hello-world turtorial. Test repository to get familiar with github

My target is to do some tutorials according Github Coupling to Jenkins for automated testing which
shall be triggered after every commit.
After that I want to be capable to integrated automated building (not sure currently what tooling)
and than do somewhat like and automated deployment but only in case of manual triggering.
So a tutorial project for CI (Continous Integration)

But first more about Github.
As this tutorial works without code I really think to start a small Hello World with some testing function
